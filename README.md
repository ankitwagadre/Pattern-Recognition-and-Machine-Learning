1. Character Recognition using Bayesian Classifier :
    A pattern recognizer on the Bayesian classifier concepts. 
    Training images of 3 characters in a folder named TrainCharacters.rar. 
    Each of the 200 training images of each class are of size 128 × 128. 
    300 test images (100 in each class) of size 128 × 128 in a separate 
    folder TestCharacters.rar.
    
2. GMM based clustering:
    A GMM based  clustering framework on the image 'building.jpg'. With 3 gaussain 
    components and RGB values as the features.
    
3.  Face Recognition using PCA:
    Face recognition using pca by computing KL transform of images in gallery.zip
    
4.  Support Vector Machines:
    A SVM Classifier using a Radial Basis Function Kernel for different values of
    penalty factors C and precisions.
